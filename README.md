## My process

### Built with

- React
- This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app.
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I mainly learned how to fully deploy and host a website on GitHub Pages. Most of the HTML and CSS was review but I learned how to fully deploy with create-react-app.

### Useful resources

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - This helped me structure and make a React app.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - This website taught me how to publish my repo as a live website.
- [Create React App Docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment#github-pages) - This helped me deploy on GitHub Pages.
